# FaceLog: Smart Attendance System

Welcome to FaceLog, a sophisticated attendance system that leverages facial recognition technology for accurate identification and integrates seamlessly with the cloud for efficient attendance management.

## Overview

FaceCloud combines the power of the dlib 64 model and OpenCV to provide precise facial recognition, ensuring a secure and reliable attendance tracking experience. With Firebase Realtime Database integration, FaceCloud offers real-time updates and accessibility from anywhere, transforming attendance management into a streamlined and modern process.

## Features

- **Advanced Facial Recognition:** Utilizes the dlib 64 model and OpenCV for high-precision facial recognition, ensuring accuracy in attendance tracking.

- **Cloud Integration:** Seamlessly connects with Firebase Realtime Database, enabling real-time updates and providing convenient access to attendance records from any device.

- **Efficient Attendance Management:** Reduces manual effort by automating the attendance tracking process and enhances accessibility through cloud integration.
